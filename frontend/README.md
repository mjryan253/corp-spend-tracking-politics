## Quick Start

### Option 1: Python HTTP Server (Recommended)

1. **Start the backend server** (from the backend directory):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Start the frontend server** (from the frontend directory):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   python server.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api/

### Option 2: Live Server (VS Code Extension)

1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"
3. The frontend will open in your browser

### Option 3: Direct File Opening

Simply open `index.html` in your browser (note: some features may not work due to CORS restrictions)

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Issues
If you see CORS errors in the browser console:
1. Make sure the backend server is running on port 8000
2. Use the Python HTTP server (`python server.py`) instead of opening the file directly
3. Check that the API endpoints are accessible

### API Connection Issues
1. Verify the backend server is running: http://localhost:8000/api/
2. Check the browser's Network tab for failed requests
3. Ensure the API endpoints match the frontend expectations

### Styling Issues
1. Check that Tailwind CSS is loading properly
2. Verify Alpine.js is working by checking the browser console
3. Ensure all CDN links are accessible

## Contributing

1. Make changes to `index.html`
2. Test with the Python HTTP server
3. Ensure the backend API is running
4. Test all search and filter functionality
